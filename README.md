To implement a real-time chat application using Java and Socket.IO, we'll create a simple server using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) in combination with Java and an HTML client that connects to it.

We'll break down the steps into two main components:

1. **Server**: A Java server using Socket.IO to handle incoming chat messages and broadcast them to all connected clients.
2. **Client**: A simple HTML+JavaScript client to send and receive messages.

### Requirements
- Java 8+
- Maven
- Socket.IO Java library

---

### Step 1: Set Up a Maven Project

### Step 2: Implement the Chat Server

Create a class `ChatServer` to set up a Socket.IO server that listens for incoming messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients.


### Step 3: Create the Client

The client will be a simple HTML file using Socket.IO to connect to the server. 


### Step 4: Run the Server and Access the Client

1. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.ChatServer"
   ```

2. **Access the Client**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   - Enter a username and a message, then click **Send** to chat.

### Explanation of Guarantees Offered by Socket.IO

Socket.IO provides several guarantees that make it suitable for real-time applications like chat:

- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO uses WebSockets by default, but it can fall back to HTTP long-polling if WebSockets arenâ€™t supported.
- **Reliability and Reconnection**: Socket.IO automatically attempts reconnection if a client disconnects, ensuring continuous communication when possible.
- **Event-Based Communication**: Using named events like `send_message` and `receive_message`, Socket.IO allows for structured and readable message handling.

With this setup, you have a basic real-time chat application where messages sent from one client are instantly broadcast to all connected clients via the server.
